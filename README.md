# AI Khmer Project

The AI Khmer Project is dedicated to advancing the understanding and utilization of the Khmer language through the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Our project focuses on training models to analyze and process Khmer language text, including tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interaction.

## Project Goals

- **Language Understanding**: Our primary goal is to develop models that can accurately understand and interpret the nuances of the Khmer language.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: We aim to build models capable of identifying and categorizing the parts of speech in Khmer text, facilitating deeper linguistic analysis.
- **Chatbot Interaction**: Through natural language processing techniques, we seek to create chatbots capable of engaging in meaningful conversations with users in Khmer text.
- **Language Support**: By developing tools and resources for Khmer language processing, we aim to support the broader Khmer-speaking community in various applications and domains.

## Features

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Our models can automatically annotate Khmer text with part-of-speech tags, providing valuable linguistic insights.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: We offer sentiment analysis capabilities to assess the emotional tone and sentiment of Khmer language text.
- **Chatbot Interaction**: Our chatbots can interact with users in Khmer text, responding to inquiries, providing information, and engaging in conversation.
- **Training and Evaluation**: We provide tools and resources for training and evaluating language models on Khmer language data, fostering continuous improvement and development.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand the capabilities of the AI Khmer Project. Whether you're a linguist, data scientist, developer, or language enthusiast, there are many ways to get involved:
